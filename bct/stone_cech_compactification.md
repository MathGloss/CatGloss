The existence of this left adjoint is far from obvious, and verifying the hypotheses of SAFT (or indeed, constructing $ F $ in any other way) requires some deep theorems of topology. Given a space $ X $ , the resulting compact Hausdorff space $ F(X) $ is called its **Stone-Cech compactification**. Provided that $ X $ satisfies some mild separation conditions, the unit of the adjunction at $ X $ is an embedding, so that $ UF(X) $ contains $ X $ as a subspace.
