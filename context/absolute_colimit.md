\begin{lem}\nThe underlying fork of a split coequalizer diagram is a coequalizer. Moreover, it is an **absolute colimit**: any functor preserves this coequalizer.\n\end{lem}\n\begin{proof}\nGiven a map $k \colon y \to w$ so that $kf=kg$, we must show that $k$ factors through $h$; uniqueness of a hypothetical factorization follows because $h$ is a split epimorphism. The factorization is given by the map $ks \colon z \to w$, as demonstrated by the following easy diagram chase:\n$$ ks h = kft=kgt=k\rlap{{\,}.}$$
