Let $\kappa$ be a regular cardinal. A locally small category $\cC$ is **locally $\kappa$-presentable** if it is cocomplete and if it has a set of objects $S$ so that:\n1. Every object in $\cC$ can be written as a colimit of a diagram valued in the subcategory spanned by the objects in $S$.\n2. For each object $s \in S$, the functor $\cC(s,-) \colon \cC \to \cat{Set}$ preserves $\kappa$-filtered colimits.\nA functor between locally $\kappa$-presentable categories is **accessible** if it preserves $\kappa$-filtered colimits.
