For any group $G$, we may define other groups:\n1. the **center** $Z(G) = \{ h \in G \mid hg = gh\, \forall g \in G\}$, a subgroup of $G$,\n2. the **commutator subgroup** $C(G)$, the subgroup of $G$ generated by elements $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ for any $g,h \in G$, and\n3. the **automorphism group** $\Aut(G)$, the group of isomorphisms $\phi \colon G \to G$ in $\cat{Group}$.\nTrivially, all three constructions define a functor from the discrete category of groups (with only identity morphisms) to $\cat{Group}$. Are these constructions functorial in\n1. the isomorphisms of groups? That is, do they extend to functors $\cat{Group}_\text{iso} \to \cat{Group}$?\n2. the epimorphisms of groups? That is, do they extend to functors $\cat{Group}_\text{epi} \to \cat{Group}$?\n3. all homomorphisms of groups? That is, do they extend to functors $\cat{Group} \to \cat{Group}$?
