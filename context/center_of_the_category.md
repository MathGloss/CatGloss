Show that for any category $\cC$, the collection of natural endomorphisms of the identity functor $1_\cC$ defines a commutative monoid, called the **center of the category**. The proof of Proposition \ref{prop:unnatural-torsion} demonstrates that the center of $\cat{Ab}_{\mathrm{fg}}$ is the multiplicative monoid $(\ZZ,\times,1)$.
