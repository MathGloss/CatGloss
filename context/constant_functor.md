For any object $c \in \cC$ and any  category $\cJ$, the **constant functor** $c \colon \cJ \to \cC$ sends every object of $\cJ$ to $c$ and every morphism in $\cJ$ to the identity morphism $1_c$. The constant functors define an embedding $\Delta \colon \cC \to \cC^{\cJ}$ that sends an object $c$ to the constant functor at $c$ and a morphism $f \colon c \to c'$ to the **constant natural transformation**, in which each component is defined to be the morphism $f$.
