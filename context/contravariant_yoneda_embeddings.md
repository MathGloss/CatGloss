An easy application of the Yoneda lemma completely characterizes natural transformations between representable functors: any locally small category $\cC$ is isomorphic to the full subcategory of $\cat{Set}^{\cC^\op}$ spanned by the contravariant represented functors, and $\cC^\op$ is isomorphic to the full subcategory of $\cat{Set}^{\cC}$ spanned by the covariant represented functors, via the canonically-defined **covariant** and **contravariant Yoneda embeddings**.
