Iterated coproducts of an object $A \in \cC$ are called **copowers** or **tensors**. For a set $I$, the $I$-indexed copower of $A$ is denoted $\coprod_I A$ or $I \cdot A$.\nThe representable universal property is expressed by the natural isomorphism\n$$ \cC(\textstyle\coprod_I A,X) \cong \cC (A,X)^I\rlap{{\,},}$$ i.e., a map $h \colon \coprod_I A \to X$ is determined by an $I$-indexed family of maps $h_i \colon A \to X$ defined by composing with each coproduct inclusion $\iota_i \colon A \to \coprod_I A$. In the case of $\cC= \cat{Set}$, the copower $\coprod_I A$ is isomorphic to the set $I \times A$.
