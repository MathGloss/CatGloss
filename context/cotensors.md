Iterated products of an object $A \in \cC$ are called **powers** or **cotensors**. For a set $I$, the $I$-indexed power of $A$ is denoted $\prod_I A$ or $A^I$.\nThe representable universal property is expressed by the natural isomorphism\n$$ \cC(X,A^I) \cong \cC (X,A)^I,$$ i.e., a map $h \colon X \to A^I$ is determined by an $I$-indexed family of maps $h_i \colon X \to A$ defined by composing with each product projection $\epsilon_i \colon A^I \to A$. In the case of $\cC= \cat{Set}$, this notation is consistent with the exponential notation introduced previously: the power $A^I$ is isomorphic to the set of functions from $I$ to $A$, and the map $\epsilon_i \colon A^I \to A$ evaluates each function at $i \in I$.
