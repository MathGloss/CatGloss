Like any abstract nonsense, this argument can be dualized. Dually, any $F \colon \cC \to \cD$ is a pointwise left Kan extension of itself along $1_\cC$. The colimit formula of Theorem \ref{thm:pointwise-equals-pointwise} applies, so\n$$ Fc \cong \colim (\cC/c \xrightarrow{\Pi} \cC \xrightarrow{F} \cD),$$ which is appropriately called the **coYoneda lemma**:
