Show that a full and faithful functor $F \colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}$ both **reflects** and **creates isomorphisms**. That is, show:
1. If $f$ is a morphism in $\mathsf{C}$ so that $Ff$ is an isomorphism in $\mathsf{D}$, then $f$ is an isomorphism.
2. If $x$ and $y$ are objects in $\mathsf{C}$ so that $Fx$ and $Fy$ are isomorphic in $\mathsf{D}$, then $x$ and $y$ are isomorphic in $\mathsf{C}$.
By Lemma \ref{lem:functors-pres-isos}, the converses of these statements hold for any functor.
