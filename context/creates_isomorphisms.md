Show that a full and faithful functor $F \colon \cC \to \cD$ both **reflects** and **creates isomorphisms**. That is, show:\n1. If $f$ is a morphism in $\cC$ so that $Ff$ is an isomorphism in $\cD$, then $f$ is an isomorphism.\n2. If $x$ and $y$ are objects in $\cC$ so that $Fx$ and $Fy$ are isomorphic in $\cD$, then $x$ and $y$ are isomorphic in $\cC$.\nBy Lemma \ref{lem:functors-pres-isos}, the converses of these statements hold for any functor.
