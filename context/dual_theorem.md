This syntactical duality has a very important consequence for the development of category theory. Any theorem containing a universal quantification of the form ``for all categories $\cC$'' also necessarily applies to the opposites of these categories. Interpreting the result in the dual context leads to a **dual theorem**, proven by the dual of the original proof, in which the direction of each arrow appearing in the argument is reversed. The result is a two-for-one deal: any proof in category theory simultaneously proves two theorems, the original statement and its dual. For example, the reader may have found Exercise \ref{exc:slice-category} redundant, precisely because the statements \eqref{itm:slice-cat-i} and \eqref{itm:slice-cat-ii} are dual; see Exercise \ref{exc:slice-cat-dual}.
