An **equivalence of categories** consists of functors $F \colon \cC \leftrightarrows \cD \colon G$ together with natural isomorphisms $\eta \colon 1_\cC \cong GF$, $\epsilon \colon FG \cong 1_\cD$. Categories $\cC$ and $\cD$ are **equivalent**, written $\cC \simeq\cD$, if there exists an equivalence between them.
