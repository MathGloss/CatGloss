A functor $F \colon \cC \to \cD$ is\n1. **full** if for each $x,y \in \cC$, the map $\cC(x,y) \to \cD(Fx,Fy)$ is surjective;\n2. **faithful** if for each $x,y \in \cC$, the map  $\cC(x,y) \to \cD(Fx,Fy)$ is injective;\n3. and **essentially surjective on objects** if for every object $d \in \cD$ there is some $c \in \cC$ such that $d$ is isomorphic to $Fc$.
