\begin{rmk} Proposition  \ref{prop:unified-adjunction} reveals that the data of a **fully-specified adjunction** can be presented in two equivalent forms: it consists of a pair of functors $F \colon \cC \rightleftarrows \cD \colon G$ together with\n1. a natural family of isomorphisms $\cD(Fc,d) \cong \cC(c,Gd)$ for all $c \in \cC$ and $d \in \cD$,\nor, equivalently,\n1. natural transformations $\eta \colon 1_\cC \To GF$ and $\epsilon \colon FG \To 1_\cD$ so that $G\epsilon \cdot \eta G = 1_G$ and $\epsilon F \cdot F \eta = 1_F$.\nIndeed, either of the unit and the counit alone, satisfying an appropriate universal property, suffices to determine a fully specified adjunction: \eqref{itm:original-defn} and \eqref{itm:unit-counit-defn} are each equivalent to either of\n1. a natural transformation $\eta \colon 1_\cC \To GF$ so that the function\n$$ \xymatrix{ \cD(Fc,d) \ar[r]^-G & \cC(GFc,Gd) \ar[r]^-{(\eta_c)^*} & \cC(c,Gd)}$$ defines an isomorphism for all $c \in \cC$ and $d \in \cD$,\nor, equivalently, and dually,\n1. a natural transformation $\epsilon \colon FG \To 1_\cD$ so that the function\n$$ \xymatrix{ \cC(c,Gd) \ar[r]^-F & \cD(Fc,FGd) \ar[r]^-{(\epsilon_d)_*} & \cD(Fc,d)}$$ defines an isomorphism for all $c \in \cC$ and $d \in \cD$.\nIn particular, a morphism of adjunctions, introduced in Exercise \ref{exc:adj-mor}, is defined to be a morphism of fully-specified adjunctions. On account of the equivalence between \eqref{itm:original-defn}, \eqref{itm:unit-counit-defn}, \eqref{itm:unit-formula}, and \eqref{itm:counit-formula}, this notion can be presented in several equivalent ways.\n\end{rmk}
