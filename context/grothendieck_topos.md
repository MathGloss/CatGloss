Given a small category $\cC$, a **presheaf** is another name for a contravariant set-valued functor on $\cC$.  A **Grothendieck topos** is a reflective full subcategory $\cE$ of a presheaf category\n$$ \xymatrix{ \cE \ar@<-1ex>@{^(->}[r] \ar@{}[r]|-\perp & \cat{Set}^{\cC^\op} \ar@<-1ex>[l]_-L}$$ with the property that the left adjoint preserves finite limits.\n Objects in $\cE$ can be characterized as sheaves on a small \emph{site}, which specifies a ``covering family'' of morphisms $(f_i \colon U_i \to U)_i$ for each object $U \in \cC$ satisfying a weak pullback condition. A typical example might take $\cC =\mathcal{O}(X)$ to be the poset of open sets for a topological space $X$. A presheaf $P \colon \mathcal{O}(X)^\op \to \cat{Set}$ assigns a set $P(U)$ to each open set $U \subset X$ so that this assignment is functorial with respect to restrictions along inclusion $V \subset U \subset X$ of open subsets. A presheaf $P$ is a **sheaf** if and only if the diagram of restriction maps\n$$ \xymatrix{ P(U) \ar[r] & \prod\limits_\alpha P(U_\alpha) \ar@<.5ex>[r] \ar@<-.5ex>[r] & \prod\limits_{\alpha,\beta} P(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)}$$ is an equalizer for every open cover $U = \cup_\alpha U_\alpha$ of a $U \in \mathcal{O}(X)$; see Definition \ref{defn:sheaf-axiom}.
