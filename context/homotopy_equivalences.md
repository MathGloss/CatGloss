$\quad$\n1. The isomorphisms in $\cat{Set}$ are precisely the **bijections**.\n2. The isomorphisms in $\cat{Group}$, $\cat{Ring}$, $\cat{Field}$, or $\cat{Mod}_R$  are the bijective homomorphisms.\n3. The isomorphisms in the category $\cat{Top}$ are the **homeomorphisms**, i.e., the continuous functions with continuous inverse, which is a stronger property than merely being a bijective continuous function.\n4. The isomorphisms in the category $\cat{Htpy}$ are the **homotopy equivalences**.\n5. In a poset $(\cP,\leq)$, the axiom of antisymmetry asserts that $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$ imply that $x=y$. That is, the only isomorphisms in the category $(\cP, \leq)$ are identities.
