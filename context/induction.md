The objects of the functor category $\cat{Vect}_\kk^{\cB G}$ are $G$-representations over the field $\kk$, and arrows are $G$-equivariant linear maps. If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, restriction $\fun{res}_H^G \colon \cat{Vect}_\kk^{\cB G} \to \cat{Vect}_\kk^{\cB H}$ of a $G$-representation to an $H$-representation is simply pre-composition by the inclusion functor $\cB H \hookrightarrow \cB G$. This functor has a left adjoint, called **induction**, and a  right adjoint, called **coinduction**.\n  $$\vcenter{\xymatrix{\cat{Vect}_\kk^{\cB G}  \ar[r]|{\mathrm{res}_H^G} & \cat{Vect}_\kk^{\cB H} \ar@/^1.5pc/[l]^{\mathrm{coind}_H^G} \ar@/_1.5pc/[l]_{\mathrm{ind}_H^G} \ar@{}[l]^*+{\labelstyle{\perp}}_*+{\labelstyle\perp} }}$$\n  By Proposition \ref{prop:kan-adjoint}, the induction functor is given by left Kan extension along the inclusion $\cB H \hookrightarrow \cB G$, while coinduction is given by right Kan extension. The reader unfamiliar with the construction of induced representations need not remain in suspense for very long; see Theorem \ref{thm:Kan-formula} and Example \ref{ex:repKan2}. Similar remarks apply for $G$-sets, $G$-spaces, based $G$-spaces, or indeed $G$-objects in any category, although if the ambient category has few limits and colimits, these adjoints need not exist.
