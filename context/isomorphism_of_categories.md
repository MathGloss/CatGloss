The category of categories gives rise to a notion of an **isomorphism of categories**, defined by interpreting Definition \ref{defn:iso} in $\cat{Cat}$ or in $\cat{CAT}$. Namely, an isomorphism of categories is given by a pair of inverse functors $F \colon \cC \to \cD$ and $G \colon \cD \to \cC$ so that the composites $GF$ and $FG$, respectively, equal the identity functors on $\cC$ and on $\cD$. An isomorphism induces a bijection between the objects of $\cC$ and objects of $\cD$ and likewise for the morphisms.
