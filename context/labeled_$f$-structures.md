Combinatorialists refer to a functor $F\colon \cat{Fin}_{\mathrm{iso}} \to \cat{Fin}$ as a **species**. The image $F(n)$ of the $n$-element set $n$ is the set of **labeled $F$-structures** on $n$. The set of **unlabeled $F$-structures** on $n$ is defined by restricting  $\cat{Fin}_{\mathrm{iso}}$ to the full subcategory spanned by the $n$-element set, i.e., to the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$ regarded as the group of automorphisms of the object $n \in \cat{Fin}_{\mathrm{iso}}$, and forming the colimit of the diagram $$\cB\Sigma_n \hookrightarrow \cat{Fin}_{\mathrm{iso}} \xrightarrow{F} \cat{Fin}.$$ Because $\fun{Ord}$ and $\fun{Sym}$ are objectwise isomorphic, the sets of labeled $\fun{Sym}$-structures and labeled $\fun{Ord}$-structures are isomorphic. However, the set of unlabeled $\fun{Sym}$-structures on $n$ is the set of conjugacy classes of permutations of $n$-elements, while the set of unlabeled $\fun{Ord}$-structures on $n$ is trivial: all linear orders on $n$ are isomorphic. See \cite{joyal-species} for more.
