$\quad$\n1. A **left deformation** on a homotopical category $\cC$ consists of an endofunctor $Q$ together with a natural weak equivalence $q \colon Q \simTo 1_\cC$.\n2. A **left deformation** for a functor $F \colon \cC \to \cD$ between homotopical categories consists of a left deformation $(Q,q)$ for $\cC$ such that $F$ preserves all weak equivalences between objects in a full subcategory containing the image of $Q$.\nThere is an obvious dual notion of **right deformation** $r \colon 1_\cC \simTo R$.
