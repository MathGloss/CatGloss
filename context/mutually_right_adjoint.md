A pair of contravariant functors $F \colon \cC^\op \to \cD$ and $G \colon \cD^\op \to \cC$ are **mutually left adjoint** if there exists a natural isomorphism $$ \cD(Fc,d) \cong \cC(Gd,c)\rlap{{\,},}$$ or **mutually right adjoint** if there exists a natural isomorphism $$ \cD(d,Fc) \cong \cC(c,Gd)\rlap{{\,}.}$$
