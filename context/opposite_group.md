$\quad$\n1. $\cat{Mat}_R^\op$ is the category whose objects are non-zero natural numbers and in which a morphism from $m$ to $n$ is an $m \times n$ matrix with values in $R$. The upshot is that a reader who would have preferred the opposite handedness conventions when defining $\cat{Mat}_R$ would have lost nothing by adopting them.\n2. When a preorder $(\cP,\leq)$ is regarded as a category, its opposite category is the category that has a morphism $x \to y$ if and only if $y \leq x$. For example, $\bbomega^\op$ is the category freely generated by the graph\n$$ \cdots \to 3 \to 2 \to 1 \to 0\rlap{{\,}.}$$\n3. If $G$ is a group, regarded as a one-object groupoid, the category $(\cB G)^\op \cong \cB (G^\op)$ is again a one-object groupoid, and hence a group. The group $G^\op$ is called the **opposite group** and is used to define right actions as a special case of left actions; see Example \ref{ex:G-actions}.
