The set of morphisms in the translation groupoid with domain $x$ is isomorphic to $G$. This set may be expressed as a disjoint union of hom-sets $\Hom_{\cT_GX}(x,y)$, where $y$ ranges over the orbit $O_x$. Each of these hom-sets is isomorphic to $\Hom_{\cT_GX}(x,x)=G_x$. In particular, $\midG\mid=\midO_x\mid\cdot\midG_x\mid$, proving the **orbit-stabilizer theorem**.
