Let $X \colon \cB G \to \cat{Set}$ be a left $G$-set. Its **translation groupoid** $\cT_GX$ has elements of $X$ as objects. A morphism $g \colon x \to y$ is an element $g \in G$ so that $g \cdot x = y$. The objects in the skeleton $\cat{sk}\cT_GX$ are the connected components in the translation groupoid. These are precisely the **orbits** of the group action, which partition $X$ in precisely this manner.
