\begin{rmk}\nA direct proof of Theorem \ref{thm:colimit-construction} simply constructs the diagram \eqref{eq:colimit-formula} in $\cC$ and checks that the coequalizer of $c$ and $d$ has the universal property that defines $\colim_\cJ F$. There is a sense in which this direct proof is quite similar to our strategy---to first verify the result in $\cat{Set}$ and then apply representability---by something  called the **philosophy of generalized elements**, first articulated by Lawvere \cite{Lawvere-ETCS}.
