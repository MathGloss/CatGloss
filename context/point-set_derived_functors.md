By the universal property of the localization functor $\cC \to \Ho\cC$, $\bL F$ and $\bR F$ are equivalently expressible as homotopical functors $\bL F, \bR F \colon \cC \rightrightarrows \Ho\cD$; these functors are often called the **left** or **right derived functors** of $F$. Sometimes, though by no means always, there exists a lift of a left or right derived functor along $\cD \to \Ho\cD$. For emphasis, we will call these lifts **point-set derived functors**, though other authors choose to call them simply ``derived functors'' \cite{riehl-categorical}.
