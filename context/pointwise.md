Left Kan extensions are dual to right Kan extensions, not under reversal of the direction of functors (the morphisms in $\cat{CAT}$), but under reversal of the direction of natural transformations (the 2-morphisms in the 2-category $\cat{CAT}$). A left Kan extension may be converted to a right Kan extension by ``replacing every category by its opposite'': a functor $K \colon \cC \to \cD$ is equally a functor $K \colon \cC^\op \to \cD^\op$ but the process of replacing each category by its opposite reverses the direction of  natural transformations, because their components are morphisms in the opposites of the target categories. A left Kan extension is **pointwise**, if the corresponding right Kan extension is pointwise:
