Lemma \ref{lem:functors-pres-isos} shows that functors preserve isomorphisms. Find an example to demonstrate that functors need not **reflect isomorphisms**: that is, find a functor $F \colon \cC \to \cD$ and a morphism $f$ in $\cC$ so that $Ff$ is an isomorphism in $\cD$ but $f$ is not an isomorphism in $\cC$.
