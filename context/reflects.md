For any class of diagrams $K \colon \cJ \to \cC$ valued in $\cC$, a functor $F \colon \cC \to \cD$\n1. **preserves** those limits if for any diagram $K \colon \cJ \to \cC$ and limit cone over $K$, the image of this cone defines a limit cone over the composite diagram $FK \colon \cJ \to \cD$;\n2. **reflects** those limits  if any cone over a diagram $K \colon \cJ \to \cC$, whose image upon applying $F$ is a limit cone for the diagram $FK \colon \cJ \to \cD$, is a limit cone over $K$; and\n3. **creates** those limits if whenever $FK \colon \cJ \to \cD$ has a limit in $\cD$, there is some limit cone over $FK$ that can be lifted to a limit cone over $K$, and moreover $F$ reflects the limits in the class of diagrams.
