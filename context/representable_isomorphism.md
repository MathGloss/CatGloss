Prove the following strengthening of Lemma \ref{lem:iso}, demonstrating the equivalence between an isomorphism in a category and a **representable isomorphism** between the corresponding co- or contravariant represented functors: the following are equivalent: 1. $f\colon x \to y$ is an isomorphism in $\mathsf{C}$.\n2. $f_* \colon \mathsf{C}(-,x) \Rightarrow \mathsf{C}(-,y)$ is a natural isomorphism.\n3. $f^* \colon \mathsf{C}(y,-) \Rightarrow \mathsf{C}(x,-)$ is a natural isomorphism.
