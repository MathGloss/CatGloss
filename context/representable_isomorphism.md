Prove the following strengthening of Lemma \ref{lem:iso}, demonstrating the equivalence between an isomorphism in a category and a **representable isomorphism** between the corresponding co- or contravariant represented functors: the following are equivalent: 1. $f\colon x \to y$ is an isomorphism in $\cC$.\n2. $f_* \colon \cC(-,x) \To \cC(-,y)$ is a natural isomorphism.\n3. $f^* \colon \cC(y,-) \To \cC(x,-)$ is a natural isomorphism.
