In a locally small category $\cC$, any pair of isomorphic objects $x \cong y$ are **representably isomorphic**, meaning that $\cC(-,x)\cong\cC(-,y)$ and $\cC(x,-) \cong \cC(y,-)$. This is an immediate consequence of the  functoriality of the Yoneda embeddings $\cC\hookrightarrow\cat{Set}^{\cC^\op}$ and $\cC^\op\hookrightarrow\cat{Set}^\cC$; see Exercise \ref{exc:rep-iso}. The Yoneda lemma supplies the converse:
