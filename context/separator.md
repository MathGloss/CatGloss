A **separating set** or **separator** for a category $\cC$ is a set $\Phi$ of objects that can distinguish between distinct parallel morphisms in the following sense: given $f,g \colon x \rightrightarrows y$, if $f \neq g$ then there exists some $h \colon c \to x$ with $c \in \Phi$ so that $fh \neq gh$. A **coseparating set** in $\cC$ is a separating set in $\cC^\op$.
