A functor $F \colon \cC \to \cD$ **strictly creates** limits for a given class of diagrams if  for any diagram $K \colon \cJ \to \cC$ in the class and limit cone over $FK \colon \cJ \to \cD$,\n1. there exists a unique lift of that cone to a cone over $K$, and\n2. moreover, this lift defines a limit cone in $\cC$.
