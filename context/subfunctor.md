A functor $F$ defines a **subfunctor** of $G$ if there is a natural transformation $\alpha \colon F \To G$ whose components are monomorphisms. In the case of $G \colon \cC^\op \to \cat{Set}$, a subfunctor is given by a collection of subsets $Fc \subset Gc$ so that each $Gf \colon Gc \to Gc'$ restricts to a function $Ff \colon Fc \to Fc'$. Characterize those subsets that assemble into a subfunctor of the representable functor $\cC(-,c)$.
