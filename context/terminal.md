$\quad$\n1. An object $c$ in a category $\cC$ is **initial** if and only if the functor $\cC(c,-) \colon \cC \to \cat{Set}$ is naturally isomorphic to the constant functor $* \colon \cC \to \cat{Set}$ that sends every object  to the singleton set.\n2. An object $c \in \cC$ is **terminal** if and only if the functor $\cC(-,c) \colon \cC^\op \to \cat{Set}$ is naturally isomorphic to the constant functor $* \colon \cC^\op \to \cat{Set}$ that sends every object  to the singleton set.
