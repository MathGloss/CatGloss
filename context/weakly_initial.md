$\quad$ 1. An object $c$ in a category $\mathsf{C}$ is **weakly initial** if for every $x \in \mathsf{C}$ there exists a morphism $c \to x$ (but possibly more than one).\n2. A collection of objects $\Phi = \{c_i\}$ in a category $\mathsf{C}$ is **jointly weakly initial** if for every $x \in \mathsf{C}$ there exists some $c_i \in \Phi$ for which there exists a morphism $c_i \to x$.
