\begin{proof}\nConsider a limit cone $(\lambda_c \colon \ell \to c)_{c \in \cC}$. The legs of the limit cone demonstrate that $\ell$ is a **weakly initial object**, admitting at least one morphism to every object $c \in \cC$. To show that $\lambda_c$ is the only morphism from $\ell$ to $c$, observe that for any  morphism $f \colon \ell \to c$, commutativity of the limit cone implies that $f \lambda_\ell = \lambda_c$. So to prove that $\ell$ is initial, it suffices to show that the cone leg $\lambda_\ell \colon \ell \to \ell$ is the identity.
