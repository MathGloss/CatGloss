A category is **abelian** if\n1. it has a **zero object** $0$, that is both initial and terminal,\n2. it has all binary products and binary coproducts,\n3. it has all **kernels** and **cokernels**, defined respectively to be the equalizer and coequalizer of a map $f \colon A \to B$ with the zero map $A \to 0 \to B$, and\n4. all monomorphisms and epimorphisms arise as kernels or cokernels, respectively.
